# Glug

*The skip-predicting game for the exceptionally bored.*

## Overview

Glug combines stone-skipping with prediction, rewarding both skill and accuracy. Before each throw, you guess how many skips you'll achieve. Guess correctly and double your points. It's designed to encourage high skip counts while rewarding consistency.

## Rules

### Setup

Decide how the game will end: when someone reaches a target score (like 50 or 100 points), after everyone completes a set number of turns, or when somebody gets tired and/or bored and wanders off.

### Turn Order

Each player throws a rock as far as possible. Turn order is furthest to shortest.

### Turn Structure

For each turn:

1. **Predict:** Announce your predicted number of skips, "glug" if 0.
2. **Skip:** Skip the rock and record the number of skips.
3. **Score:** Score the throw based on the skips and prediction.

### Scoring

You earn one point for each skip your rock achieves. If your prediction was exactly correct, double your points. For example, if you predict 4 skips and achieve 4 skips, you score 8 points. If you predict 4 skips but only achieve 2, you score 2 points.

There are two special cases.

1. If you predict "glug" (zero skips) and your rock sinks immediately (glugs), you earn 1 point.
2. If you skip / throw your rock to the opposite shore, you earn +2 bonus points in addition to your skip points, regardless of your prediction.

> [!NOTE]  
> A skip in this game corresponds to a deflection off the surface of the water, not the number of ripples. A rock that skips n times produces n + 1 ripples, the last being when it finally stops skipping (and thus doesn't count).

## Notes

This game draws inspiration from stone-skipping and track-based card games like Blackout. It's meant to be light-hearted and adaptable, so feel free to modify the rules to suit your group.
